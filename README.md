# single-pin-rotary-encoder
Connet one or two rotary encoders to an MCU by using only one (analog) input port.

Usually a rotary encoder requires two microcontroller inputs, and three if it has a built-in pushbutton. Connecting two of these encoders would need six inputs, three need nine, and so on. However, when the microcontroller has an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) peripheral and an analog input pin to spare, then that is all you need.
